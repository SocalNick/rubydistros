# rubydistros

Dockerfiles for Ruby on various Windows and Linux distros

## Why?

In a perfect world your Ruby app runs on Ruby and you don't care what distro is running under the hood. Unfortunatly we don't always live in that perfect world. Sometimes it's very important that Ruby be running on a specific distro. That's why we have rubydistros, which a stock Ruby installation along with compilers needed for gem installation.
