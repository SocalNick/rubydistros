# rubydistros

Dockerfiles for Ruby on various Linux distros

## Why?

In a perfect world you're ruby app runs on Ruby and you don't care what distro is running under the hood. Unfortunatly we don't always live in that perfect world. Sometimes it's very important that Ruby be running on a specific distro. That's why we have rubydistros.
